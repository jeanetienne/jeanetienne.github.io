Context: YOW connected, IoT, I thought i'd be served some "the future is magical, let's all jump on the technology badwagon" but some were critical of the way things are turning. Did Josh publicly bag Uber many times? Tbc?

Post conference discussion with colleagues: example of candles being obsoleted by lightbulbs. (candles = taxi), (lightbulbs = Uber).
That's a disgusting, over-simplified token example everyone uses.
Here, Uber is ONE company, not a standard like lightbulbs. Even lightbulbs tried (and succeeded) in creating a cartel (link to article with OSRAM and Phillips mafia).
Not all disrupting changes are good. They're not even disrupting, they're still provinding a driver in a car, just like taxis. Nothing really new.

Another important point we seem to all be missing, is that anyone with an arm, or just even a strong gaze can catch a taxi. Uber is only for rich people with a smartphone. Talk about inclusiveness!

Uber is a bad company
	- links to:
		- french launch campaign in Lyon
		- smear campaign against Sarah Lacy/Pando
		- Insurance problems with drivers
		- underpaid drivers
		- drivers carrying gun
		- drivers assaulting passenger (find numbers, perhaps by the volume of Uber, it's actually the same as taxis?!)
		- Uber -> Boober
		- Kalanis beng a mysoginist pig, this culture permeates the company
		
The silicon valley attitude:
	- X is broken, so I'll throw heaps of money, make a company to fix X, and we'll find a solution for rich white men.

Social dumping: You offer an Uber job to someone who doesn't have a job, sure they'll take it, but that's disregarding decades of social changes and progress where workers have fought to not be just disposable labour at the whim of the boss or the market. BUt because now it's in a comfortable car with a shiny iPhone app telling you where to pick clients, people realise it less. In the meantime we've been able to build public roads, to have fairly standardised and interoperable phone networks to run the internet on, you have a power grid to recharge your phone, and a petrol delivery grid to fuel the car (devil's advocate). Uber is running on all of this. Giving the young trendy urbanite one more way to move around

Why not developing, improving on the existing model? Sure taxis are not the best, but they're a regulated profession, they have requirements, they're unionised (to be verified?), if they do something wrong, you can lodge a complaint. If Uber driver does something, nobody will protect you.

Here in Melbourne trains don't have real time information, trains are somewhat unreliable, sometimes. Is a company thinking of rolling out their own train lines and running their own trains? With drivers that don't have specific training and may not know how a level crossing works? Then in the poor areas, they wouldn't run trains because it wouldn't be cost effective. Uber-trains would only run from upper-middle class residential area to the CBD during the day, and restaurant district at night. What about the underpaid worker coming to clean our offices after we leave them at night? Not obnly they're working a low paid job, taxing on their body but they should walk to work. Next step the we will ask them to be thankful to even have a job...

In an ideal world public transport, and taxis are part of them, would have government incentive to go service remote or poor areas. Running a bus line in the middle of the bush so 3 kids can go to school isn't cost effective? Well too bad, we as a society should pay for it. Why would society indirectly tell people they have to live in a city if they want public transport. Is it the fine print when we say "Public transport for all"? Conditions apply, only if you live with 5km of a major urban area, have a smartphone and want to ride in a Uber.
Is that the societey we want?

So instead of building a company to "disrupt" the taxi business by making it cheaper and at the same time only accessible to a richer class of society. Why don't we work on making taxis more affordable, secure, accessible? Or even regular public transport. Like in (example of city with great PT, where society care more about its citizens than corporations). What if we give existing Taxi drivers the technology we give to Uber drivers. It shouldn't be hard, all taxi drivers already have a smartphone! And there's already a body that know all about taxis around the city. For people without a smartphone, let's make a toll free phone number that you can call anywhere, from the streets, public phone booths, yes, existing infrastructure! Or even just a button to press at every bus stop, tram stop, train stop, to call a taxi when regular PT isn't running anymore. Hey society, we can do that! And in the process the wealth is redistributed a bit more equally, instead of enriching yet another mysogynist pig.
	
Conclusion:
- I'd like to see my coworkers and fellow software engineers realise that a new product isn't just cool because it's running on your iPhone, and it solves a problem that you have. Sofware has the ability to be delivered in a second across the world, we have the responsibility to design and make solutions (not products) that help the world, not just rich white men who can't wait another 5 min to raise their hand and ride a taxi.
Technology isn't the only way forward. Societal changes, cooperation, evolution is also possible.

Then take an action, and "Put your feet where your mouth is". If you think you only riding Uber from time to time is no big deal, and that your actions have no efect in the grand scheme, then why do you even vote? Our rights erode only if we don't use them. Then take actions. Sanction evil companies by not giving them your money. In a capitalist society thats the best you can do!
